As you benefit from reading good documentation, you should “pay it forward” by writing good documentation.


Javadoc scans your source files looking for documentation comments, also known as “Javadoc comments”. They begin with `/**` (two stars) and end with `*/` (one star).
 Anything in between is considered part of the documentation.

Here's a class definition with two Javadoc comments, one for the `Goodbye` class and one for the `main` method:

```code
/**
 * Example program that demonstrates print vs println.
 */
public class Goodbye {

    /**
     * Prints a greeting.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Goodbye, ");  // note the space
        System.out.println("cruel world");
    }
}
```

The class comment explains the purpose of the class. The method comment explains what the method does.

Notice that this example also has an end-of-line comment (`//`). In general, these comments are short phrases that help explain complex parts of a program. They are intended for other programmers reading and maintaining the source code.

In contrast, Javadoc comments are longer, usually complete sentences. They explain what each method does, but they omit details about how the method works. And they are intended for people who will use the methods without looking at the source code.

Appropriate comments and documentation are essential for making source code readable. And remember that the person most likely to read your code in the future, and appreciate good documentation, is you.
