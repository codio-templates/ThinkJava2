So far you have seen local variables, which are declared inside a method, and instance variables, which are declared in a class definition, usually before the method definitions. Now it's time to learn about **class variables**. They are shared across all instances of the class.



Like instance variables, class variables are defined in a class definition, before the method definitions. But they are identified by the keyword `static`. Here is a version of ``Card`` in which [RANKS and SUITS are defined as class variables:](open_file code/ch12/Card2.java panel=0 ref="public static final String[] RANKS" count=6)


```code
public class Card {

    public static final String[] RANKS = {
        null, "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
        "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};

    public static final String[] SUITS = {
        "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"};

    // instance variables and constructors go here

    public String toString() {
        return RANKS[this.rank] + " of " + SUITS[this.suit];
    }
}
```

 Class variables are allocated when the program begins and persist until the program ends. In contrast, instance variables like `rank` and `suit` are allocated when the program creates `new` objects, and they are deleted when the object is garbage-collected (see Section 10.9).


Class variables are often used to store constant values that are needed in several places. In that case, they should also be declared as `final`. Note that whether a variable is `static` or `final` involves two separate considerations: `static` means the variable is *shared*, and `final` means the variable (or in this case, the reference) is *constant*.

Naming `static final` variables with capital letters is a common convention that makes it easier to recognize their role in the class. In the `toString` method, we refer to `SUITS` and `RANKS` as if they were local variables, but we can tell that they are class variables.

One advantage of defining `SUITS` and `RANKS` as class variables is that they don't need to be created (and garbage-collected) every time `toString` is called. They may also be needed in other methods and classes, so it's helpful to make them available everywhere.
