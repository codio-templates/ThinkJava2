If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are 1 inch long, you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:



> If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, you cannot form a triangle.


Write a program named *Triangle.java* that inputs three integers, and then outputs whether you can (or cannot) form a triangle from the given lengths. Reuse your code from the previous exercise to validate the inputs. Display an error if any of the lengths are negative or zero. {Run!|terminal}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch05/Triangle.java java -cp code/ch05/ Triangle 4)
