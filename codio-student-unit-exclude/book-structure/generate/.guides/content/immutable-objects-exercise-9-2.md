You might be sick of the `factorial` method by now, but we're going to do one more version.



1. Create a new program called *Big.java* and write an iterative version of `factorial` (using a `for` loop).
1. Display a table of the integers from 0 to 30 along with their factorials. At some point around 15, you will probably see that the answers are not correct anymore. Why not?
1. Convert `factorial` so that it performs its calculation using BigIntegers and returns a `BigInteger` as a result. You can leave the parameter alone; it will still be an integer.
1. Try displaying the table again with your modified factorial method. Is it correct up to 30? How high can you make it go? {Test your code}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch09/Big.java java -cp code/ch09/ Big 1)
