Some methods perform a computation and return a result. For example, `nextDouble` reads input from the keyboard and returns it as a `double`. Other methods, like `println`, carry out a sequence of actions without returning a result. Java uses the keyword `void` to define such methods:


```code
public static void newLine() {
    System.out.println();
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("First line.");
    newLine();
    System.out.println("Second line.");
}
```


In this example, the `newLine` and `main` methods are both `public`, which means they can be **invoked** (or “called”) from other classes. And they are both `void`, which means that they don't return a result (in contrast to `nextDouble`). The output of the program is shown here:

```code
First line.

Second line.
```

Notice the extra space between the lines. If we wanted more space between them, we could invoke the same method repeatedly. Or we could write yet another method (named `threeLine`) that displays three blank lines:





See the example java code in the left pane. To compile and run the code, press the "Run"!
{Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch04/NewLine.java java -cp code/ch04/ NewLine )
 In this example, the name of the class is `NewLine`. By convention, class names begin with a capital letter. `NewLine` contains three methods, `newLine`, `threeLine`, and `main`. Remember that Java is case-sensitive, so `NewLine` and `newLine` are not the same.


By convention, method names begin with a lowercase letter and use “camel case”, which is a cute name for `jammingWordsTogetherLikeThis`. You can use any name you want for methods, except `main` or any of the Java keywords.
