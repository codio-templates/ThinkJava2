**Exercise 8.1:**
The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple methods. Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:



> 99 bottles of beer on the wall,<br/>
> 99 bottles of beer,<br/>
> ya' take one down, ya' pass it around,<br/>
> 98 bottles of beer on the wall.


Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the last verse:



> No bottles of beer on the wall,<br/>
> no bottles of beer,<br/>
> ya' can't take one down, ya' can't pass it around,<br/>
> 'cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!


And then the song (finally) ends.

Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”. 
Your program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you might want to write additional methods to separate other parts of the program.
As you develop your code, test it with a small number of verses, like `3`.
