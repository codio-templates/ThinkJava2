Create a program called *Recurse.java* and type in the following methods:

```code
/**
 * Returns the first character of the given String.
 */
public static char first(String s) {
    return s.charAt(0);
}
```

```code
/**
 * Returns all but the first letter of the given String.
 */
public static String rest(String s) {
    return s.substring(1);
}
```

```code
/**
 * Returns all but the first and last letter of the String.
 */
public static String middle(String s) {
    return s.substring(1, s.length() - 1);
}
```

```code
/**
 * Returns the length of the given String.
 */
public static int length(String s) {
    return s.length();
}
```



1. Write some code in `main` that tests each of these methods. Make sure they work, and you understand what they do.
1. Using these methods, and without using any other `String` methods, write a method called `printString` that takes a string as a parameter and displays the letters of the string, one on each line. It should be a `void` method.
1. Again using only these methods, write a method called `printBackward` that does the same thing as `printString` but displays the string backward (again, one character per line).
1. Now write a method called `reverseString` that takes a string as a parameter and returns a new string as a return value. The new string should contain the same letters as the parameter, but in reverse order: ```code
String backwards = reverseString("coffee");
System.out.println(backwards);
The output of this example code should be as follows: 
```code
eeffoc
```
1. A palindrome is a word that reads the same both forward and backward, like “otto” and “palindromeemordnilap”. Here's one way to test whether a string is a palindrome: 

> A single letter is a palindrome, a two-letter word is a palindrome if the letters are the same, and any other word is a palindrome if the first letter is the same as the last and the middle is a palindrome.
 
 Write a recursive method named `isPalindrome` that takes a `String` and returns a `boolean` indicating whether the word is a palindrome.
