When you look for a word in a dictionary, you don't search page by page from front to back. Since the words are in alphabetical order, you probably use a **binary search** algorithm:



1. Start on a page near the middle of the dictionary.
1. Compare a word on the page to the word you are looking for. If you find it, stop.
1. If the word on the page comes before the word you are looking for, flip to somewhere later in the dictionary and go to step 2.
1. If the word on the page comes after the word you are looking for, flip to somewhere earlier in the dictionary and go to step 2.



This algorithm is much faster than sequential search, because it rules out half of the remaining words each time you make a comparison. If at any point you find two adjacent words on the page, and your word comes between them, you can conclude that your word is not in the dictionary.

Getting back to the array of cards, [we can write a faster version of search if we know the cards are in order:](open_file code/ch12/Search.java panel=0 ref="* Binary search" count=21)


```code
public static int binarySearch(Card[] cards, Card target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = cards.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;                 // step 1
        int comp = cards[mid].compareTo(target);

        if (comp == 0) {                            // step 2
            return mid;
        } else if (comp < 0) {                      // step 3
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {                                    // step 4
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

 First, we declare `low` and `high` variables to represent the range we are searching. Initially, we search the entire array, from `0` to `cards.length - 1`.

Inside the `while` loop, we repeat the four steps of binary search:



1. Choose an index between `low` and `high`---call it `mid`---and compare the card at `mid` to the target.
1. If you found the target, return its index (which is `mid`).
1. If the card at `mid` is lower than the target, search the range from `mid + 1` to `high`.
1. If the card at `mid` is higher than the target, search the range from `low` to `mid - 1`.



If `low` exceeds `high`, there are no cards in the range, so we terminate the loop and return `-1`.

This algorithm depends on only the `compareTo` method of the object, so we can use this code with any object type that provides `compareTo`. See how both sequential ``search`` and ``binarySearch`` work here. See the test cases in the ``main`` class to understand what is being outputted.
