In Poker a “flush” is a hand that contains five or more cards of the same suit. A hand can contain any number of cards.




1. Write a method called `suitHist` that takes an array of cards as a parameter and returns a histogram of the suits in the hand. Your solution should traverse the array only once, as in Section 7.7.
1. Write a method called `hasFlush` that takes an array of cards as a parameter and returns `true` if the hand contains a flush (and `false` otherwise).
1. A “royal flush” includes the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 (all in the same suit). Write a method called `hasRoyal` that determines whether an array of cards contains a royal flush.
Once you have written your function and added test cases, run your code here.
