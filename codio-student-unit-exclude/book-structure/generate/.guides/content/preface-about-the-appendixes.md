The chapters of this book are meant to be read in order, because each one builds on the previous one. We also include several appendixes with material that can be read at any time:

* **Appendix A, “Tools”** This appendix explains how to download and install Java so you can compile programs on your computer. It also provides a brief introduction to DrJava---an integrated development environment designed primarily for students---and other development tools, including Checkstyle for code quality and JUnit for testing.
* **Appendix B, “Javadoc”** It's important to document your classes and methods so that other programmers (including yourself in the future) will know how to use them. This appendix explains how to read documentation, how to write documentation, and how to use the Javadoc tool.
* **Appendix C, “Graphics”** Java provides libraries for working with graphics and animation, and these topics can be engaging for students. The libraries require object-oriented features that students will not completely understand until after Chapter 10, but they can be used much earlier.
* **Appendix D, “Debugging”** We provide debugging suggestions throughout the book, but this appendix provides many more suggestions on how to debug your programs. We recommend that you review this appendix frequently as you work through the book.
