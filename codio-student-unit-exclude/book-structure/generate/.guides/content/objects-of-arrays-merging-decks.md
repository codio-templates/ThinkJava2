The next helper method we need is `merge`, which takes two sorted subdecks and returns a new deck containing all cards from both decks, in order. Here's what the algorithm looks like in pseudocode, assuming the subdecks are named `d1` and `d2`:

```code
private static Deck merge(Deck d1, Deck d2) {
    // create a new deck, d3, big enough for all the cards

    // use the index i to keep track of where we are at in
    // the first deck, and the index j for the second deck
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;

    // the index k traverses the result deck
    for (int k = 0; k < d3.length; k++) {
        // if d1 is empty, use top card from d2
        // if d2 is empty, use top card from d1
        // otherwise, compare the top two cards

        // add lowest card to the new deck at k
        // increment i or j (depending on card)
    }
    // return the new deck
}
```

An exercise at the end of the chapter asks you to implement `merge`. It's a little tricky, so be sure to test it with different subdecks. Once your `merge` method is working, you can use it to write a simplified version of merge sort:

```code
public Deck almostMergeSort() {
    // divide the deck into two subdecks
    // sort the subdecks using selectionSort
    // merge the subdecks, return the result
}
```

If you have working versions of `subdeck`, `selectionSort`, and `merge`, you should have no trouble getting this method working. But it is still not very efficient, because it uses `selectionSort` to sort the subdecks. We can make it more efficient if we use `mergeSort` instead, but that means we have to make it recursive!
