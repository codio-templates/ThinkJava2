The point of this exercise is to make sure you understand the mechanism for returning new objects from methods. The following code uses `findCenter` and `distance` as defined in this chapter.



1. Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before `findCenter` returns. Include all variables and parameters, and show the objects those variables refer to.
1. Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before `distance` returns. Show all variables, parameters, and objects.
1. What is the output of this program? (Can you tell without running it?)



```code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Point blank = new Point(5, 8);

    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 2, 4, 4);
    Point center = findCenter(rect);

    double dist = distance(center, blank);
    System.out.println(dist);
}
```
