Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters and the same number of each letter.
For example, “stop” is an anagram of “pots”, “allen downey” is an anagram of “well annoyed”, and “christopher mayfield” is an anagram of “hi prof the camel is dry”.
Write a method that takes two strings and checks whether they are anagrams of each other.
Once you have written your function and added test cases, run your code here.
