**Exercise 6.6:**
In Scrabble\footnote{Scrabble is a registered trademark owned in the USA and Canada by Hasbro Inc., and in the rest of the world by J.\ W.\ Spear \& Sons Limited of Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc.} each player has a set of tiles with letters on them. The object of the game is to use those letters to spell words. The scoring system is complex, but longer words are usually worth more than shorter words.


Imagine you are given your set of tiles as a string, like `"quijibo"`, and you are given another string to test, like `"jib"`.

Write a method called `canSpell` that takes two strings and checks whether the set of tiles can spell the word. You might have more than one tile with the same letter, but you can use each tile only once.
