Let's say you are given a number, $a$, and you want to find its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the answer, $x_0$, and then improve the guess by using this formula: $ x_1 =(x_0 + a/x_0) / 2 $ For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with $x_0 = 6$, then $x_1 = (6 + 9/6) / 2 = 3.75$, which is closer. We can repeat the procedure, using $x_1$ to calculate $x_2$, and so on. In this case, $x_2 = 3.075$ and $x_3 = 3.00091$. So the repetition converges quickly on the correct answer.

Write a method called `squareRoot` that takes a `double` and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use `Math.sqrt`.

As your initial guess, you should use $a/2$. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use `Math.abs` to calculate the absolute value of the difference.
