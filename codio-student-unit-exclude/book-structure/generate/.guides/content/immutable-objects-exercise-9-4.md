One way to calculate $e^x$ is to use the following infinite series expansion. The $i$th term in the series is $x^i / i!$. $ e^x = 1 + x + x^2 / 2! + x^3 / 3! + x^4 / 4! + ... $


1. Write a method called `myexp` that takes `x` and `n` as parameters and estimates $e^x$ by adding the first `n` terms of this series. You can use the `factorial` method from Section 8.3 or your iterative version from the previous exercise. {Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch09/MoreExponents.java java -cp code/ch09/ MoreExponents 1)
1. You can make this method more efficient by observing that the numerator of each term is the same as its predecessor multiplied by `x`, and the denominator is the same as its predecessor multiplied by `i`. Use this observation to eliminate the use of `Math.pow` and `factorial`, and check that you get the same result.
1. Write a method called `check` that takes a parameter, `x`, and displays `x`, `myexp(x)`, and `Math.exp(x)`. The output should look like this: ```code
1.0     2.708333333333333     2.718281828459045
``` Use the escape sequence `'\t'` to display a tab character between each of the values.
1. Vary the number of terms in the series (the second argument that `check` sends to `myexp`) and see the effect on the accuracy of the result. Adjust this value until the estimated value agrees with the correct answer when `x` is 1. {Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch09/MoreExponents.java java -cp code/ch09/ MoreExponents 2)
1. Write a loop in `main` that invokes `check` with the values 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0. How does the accuracy of the result vary as `x` varies? Compare the number of digits of agreement rather than the difference between the actual and estimated values.
1. Add a loop in `main` that checks `myexp` with the values -0.1, -1.0, -10.0, and -100.0. Comment on the accuracy.
