People often make the mistake of writing a lot of code before they try to compile and run it. Then they spend way too much time debugging. A better approach is **incremental development**. Its key aspects are as follows:



* Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you will know where to look.
* Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can check them, either with print statements or by using a debugger.
* Once the program is working, you can consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions (but only if it does not make the program more difficult to read).



As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. By the usual definition:

$ distance = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 +(y_2 - y_1)^2} $

The first step is to consider what a `distance` method should look like in Java. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)? For this method, the parameters are the two points, and it is natural to represent them using four `double` values. The return value is the distance, which should also have type `double`.


Already we can write an outline for the method, which is sometimes called a **stub**. The stub includes the method declaration and a `return` statement:

```code
public static double distance
        (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    return 0.0;  // stub
}
```

The `return` statement is a placeholder that is necessary only for the program to compile. At this stage, the program doesn't do anything useful, but it is good to compile it so we can find any syntax errors before we add more code.


It's usually a good idea to think about testing *before* you develop new methods; doing so can help you figure out how to implement them. To test the method, we can invoke it from `main` by using the sample values:

```code
double dist = distance(1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0);
```

With these values, the horizontal distance is 3.0 and the vertical distance is 4.0. So the result should be 5.0, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When you are testing a method, it is necessary to know the right answer.

Once we have compiled the stub, we can start adding code one line at a time. After each incremental change, we recompile and run the program. If there is an error, we have a good idea of where to look: the lines we just added.

The next step is to find the differences, $x_2 - x_1$ and $y_2 - y_1$. We store those values in temporary variables named `dx` and `dy`, so that we can examine them with print statements before proceeding. They should be 3.0 and 4.0:

```code
public static double distance
        (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    double dx = x2 - x1;
    double dy = y2 - y1;
    System.out.println("dx is " + dx);
    System.out.println("dy is " + dy);
    return 0.0;  // stub
}
```


We will remove the print statements when the method is finished. Code like that is called **scaffolding**, because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.

The next step is to square `dx` and `dy`. We could use the `Math.pow` method, but it is simpler (and more efficient) to multiply each term by itself. Then we add the squares and print the result so far:

```code
public static double distance
        (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    double dx = x2 - x1;
    double dy = y2 - y1;
    double dsquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
    System.out.println("dsquared is " + dsquared);
    return 0.0;  // stub
}
```

Again, you should compile and run the program at this stage and check the intermediate value, which should be 25.0. Finally, we can use `Math.sqrt` to compute and return the result:

```code
public static double distance
        (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    double dx = x2 - x1;
    double dy = y2 - y1;
    double dsquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
    double result = Math.sqrt(dsquared);
    return result;
}
```

 As you gain more experience programming, you might write and debug more than one line at a time. But if you find yourself spending a lot of time debugging, consider taking smaller steps.
