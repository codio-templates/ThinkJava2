                 Although `switch` statements appear longer than chained `else if` blocks, they are particularly useful when multiple cases can be grouped, as seen [on the left.](open_file code/ch05/Switch.java panel=0 ref="fall" count=15) Remove the comment symbols in front of the code and then press the "Run!"
