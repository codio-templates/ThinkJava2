      The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing the traversal patterns in this chapter. The following methods are hard to read, because instead of using meaningful names for the variables and methods, they use names of fruit.
      
      For each method, write one sentence that describes what the method does, without getting into the details of how it works. And for each variable, identify the role it plays.

      ```code
      public static int banana(int[] a) {
          int kiwi = 1;
          int i = 0;
          while (i < a.length) {
              kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
              i++;
          }
          return kiwi;
      }
      ```

      ```code
      public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
          for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
              if (a[i] == grape) {
                  return i;
              }
          }
          return -1;
      }
      ```

      ```code
      public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
          int pear = 0;
          for (int pine: a) {
              if (pine == apple) {
                  pear++;
              }
          }
          return pear;

      The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple methods. Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:



      > 99 bottles of beer on the wall,<br/>
      > 99 bottles of beer,<br/>
      > ya' take one down, ya' pass it around,<br/>
      > 98 bottles of beer on the wall.


      Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the last verse:



      > No bottles of beer on the wall,<br/>
      > no bottles of beer,<br/>
      > ya' can't take one down, ya' can't pass it around,<br/>
      > 'cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!


      And then the song (finally) ends.

      Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”. 
      Your program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you might want to write additional methods to separate other parts of the program.
      As you develop your code, test it with a small number of verses, like `3`.

      In this exercise, you will use a stack diagram to understand the execution of the following recursive method:

      ```code
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println(prod(1, 4));
      }

      public static int prod(int m, int n) {
          if (m == n) {
              return n;
          } else {
              int recurse = prod(m, n - 1);
              int result = n * recurse;
              return result;
          }
      }
      ```



      1. Draw a stack diagram showing the state of the program just before the last invocation of `prod` completes.
      1. What is the output of this program? (Try to answer this question on paper first; then run the code to check your answer.)
      1. Explain in a few words what `prod` does (without getting into the details of how it works).
      1. Rewrite `prod` without the temporary variables `recurse` and `result`. *Hint:* You need only one line for the `else` branch.

      The goal of this exercise is to translate a recursive definition into a Java method. The Ackermann function is defined for non-negative integers as follows:
      $$
      A(m, n) = \begin{cases}
                    n+1 & \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
              A(m-1, 1) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
      A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n > 0
      \end{cases}
      $$

      Write a recursive method called `ack` that takes two `int`s as parameters and that computes and returns the value of the Ackermann function.

      Test your implementation of Ackermann by invoking it from `main` and displaying the return value.
      Note the return value gets very big very quickly.
      You should try it only for small values of $m$ and $n$ (not bigger than 3).

      Many of the patterns you have seen for traversing arrays can also be written recursively. It is not common, but it is a useful exercise.



      1. Write a method called `maxInRange` that takes an array of integers and two indexes, `lowIndex` and `highIndex`, and finds the maximum value in the array, but considering only the elements between `lowIndex` and `highIndex`, including both. This method should be recursive. If the length of the range is 1 (i.e., if `lowIndex == highIndex`), we know immediately that the sole element in the range must be the maximum. So that's the base case. If there is more than one element in the range, we can break the array into two pieces, find the maximum in each piece, and then find the maximum of the maxima.
      1. Methods like `maxInRange` can be awkward to use. To find the largest element in an array, we have to provide the range for the entire array: ```code
      double max = maxInRange(a, 0, a.length - 1);
      ``` Write a method called `max` that takes an array and uses `maxInRange` to find and return the largest element.

      Create a program called *Recurse.java* and type in the following methods:

      ```code
      /**
       * Returns the first character of the given String.
       */
      public static char first(String s) {
          return s.charAt(0);
      }
      ```

      ```code
      /**
       * Returns all but the first letter of the given String.
       */
      public static String rest(String s) {
          return s.substring(1);
      }
      ```

      ```code
      /**
       * Returns all but the first and last letter of the String.
       */
      public static String middle(String s) {
          return s.substring(1, s.length() - 1);
      }
      ```

      ```code
      /**
       * Returns the length of the given String.
       */
      public static int length(String s) {
          return s.length();
      }
      ```



      1. Write some code in `main` that tests each of these methods. Make sure they work, and you understand what they do.
      1. Using these methods, and without using any other `String` methods, write a method called `printString` that takes a string as a parameter and displays the letters of the string, one on each line. It should be a `void` method.
      1. Again using only these methods, write a method called `printBackward` that does the same thing as `printString` but displays the string backward (again, one character per line).
      1. Now write a method called `reverseString` that takes a string as a parameter and returns a new string as a return value. The new string should contain the same letters as the parameter, but in reverse order: ```code
      String backwards = reverseString("coffee");
      System.out.println(backwards);
      The output of this example code should be as follows: 
      ```code
      eeffoc
      ```
      1. A palindrome is a word that reads the same both forward and backward, like “otto” and “palindromeemordnilap”. Here's one way to test whether a string is a palindrome: 

      > A single letter is a palindrome, a two-letter word is a palindrome if the letters are the same, and any other word is a palindrome if the first letter is the same as the last and the middle is a palindrome.
       
       Write a recursive method named `isPalindrome` that takes a `String` and returns a `boolean` indicating whether the word is a palindrome.

      Working with cards is more fun if you can display them on the screen. If you have not already read Appendix 20 about 2D graphics, you should read it before working on this exercise. In the code directory for this chapter, *ch12*, you will find the following:



      * *cardset-oxymoron* <br/> A directory containing images of playing cards.
      * *CardTable.java* <br/> A sample program that demonstrates how to read and display images.




      *CardTable.java* demonstrates the use of a 2D array; specifically, an array of card images. The declaration looks like this:

      ```code
      private Image[][] images;
      ```

      The variable `images` refers to a 2D array of `Image` objects, which are defined in the `java.awt` package. Here's the code that creates the array itself:

      ```code
      images = new Image[14][4];
      ```

      The array has 14 rows (one for each rank, plus an unused row for rank 0) and 4 columns (one for each suit). Here's the loop that populates the array:

      ```code
      String cardset = "cardset-oxymoron";
      String suits = "cdhs";

      for (int suit = 0; suit <= 3; suit++) {
          char c = suits.charAt(suit);

          for (int rank = 1; rank <= 13; rank++) {
              String s = String.format("%s/%02d%c.gif",
                                       cardset, rank, c);
              images[rank][suit] = new ImageIcon(s).getImage();
          }
      }
      ```

      The variable `cardset` is the name of the directory that contains the image files. `suits` is a string that contains the single-letter abbreviations for the suits. These strings are used to assemble `s`, which contains the filename for each image. For example, when `rank=1` and `suit=2`, the value of `s` is `"cardset-oxymoron/01h.gif"`, which is an image of the Ace of Hearts.

      The last line of the loop reads the image file, extracts an `Image` object, and assigns it to a location in the array, as specified by the indexes `rank` and `suit`. For example, the image of the Ace of Hearts is stored in row 1, column 2.

      If you compile and run *CardTable.java*, you should see images of a deck of cards laid out on a green table. You can use this class as a starting place to implement your own card games.



      As a starting place, try placing cards on the table in the starting configuration for the solitaire game Klondike ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire))).

      You can get the image for the back of the card by reading the file *back192.gif*.
