                 This technique is sometimes called **pseudocode**, and it is also found as a series of comments within the stub method [at the left.](open_file code/ch13/Deck.java panel=0 ref="shuffle" count=6)

                 In this case, we need a method that chooses a random integer in a given range and a method that takes two indexes and swaps the cards at those positions. These stub methods are in the code file [on the left.](open_file code/ch13/Deck.java panel=0 ref="int low" count=10)
