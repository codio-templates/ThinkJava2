      Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common English meanings.
      For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they are different.

      Before you do anything else, make sure you know how to run a Java program within the platform.

      * At the left is the Hello World program from the beginning of this chapter. Press the "Run!" and make sure it works.
        {Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch01/Hello4.java java -cp code/ch01/ Hello4 1)

      * Add a print statement that displays a second message after the `Hello, World!`.
        Say something witty like, `How are you?`.
        Press the "Run!" to see how it worked.
        {Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch01/Hello4.java java -cp code/ch01/ Hello4 2)

      * Add a comment to the program (anywhere).
        Press the "Run!" to see how it worked.
        {Run!}(sh .guides/bg.sh javac code/ch01/Hello4.java java -cp code/ch01/ Hello4 3)
        The new comment should not affect the result.

      This exercise may seem trivial, but it is the starting place for many of the programs we will work with.
      To debug with confidence, you will need to have confidence in your programming environment.

      In some environments, it is easy to lose track of which program is executing.
      You might find yourself trying to debug one program while you are accidentally running another.
      Adding (and changing) print statements is a simple way to be sure that the program you are looking at is the program you are running.

      It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces.
      Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it.
      But sometimes the error messages are misleading.
      Over time you will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler and when you have to figure things out yourself.

      Starting with the Hello World program, try out each of the following errors.
      After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), and then fix the error.

      * Remove one of the opening curly braces.
      * Remove one of the closing curly braces.
      * Instead of `main`, write `mian`.
      * Remove the word `static`.
      * Remove the word `public`.
      * Remove the word `System`.
      * Replace `println` with `Println`.
      * Replace `println` with `print`.
      * Delete one parenthesis.
      * Add an extra parenthesis.
      
      Press the "Run!" to see how these changes, and any others you can think of, work.
