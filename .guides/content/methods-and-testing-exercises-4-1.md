The purpose of this exercise is to take code from a previous exercise and redesign it as a method that takes parameters. Start with a working solution to Exercise 2.2.



1. Write a method called `printAmerican` that takes the day, date, month, and year as parameters and displays them in American format.
1. Test your method by invoking it from `main` and passing appropriate arguments. The output should look something like this (except the date might be different): ```code
Monday, July 22, 2019
```
1. Once you have debugged `printAmerican`, write another method called `printEuropean` that displays the date in European format.
