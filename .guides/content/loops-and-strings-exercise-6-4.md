A word is said to be “abecedarian” if the letters in the word appear in alphabetical order. For example, the following are all six-letter English abecedarian words:



> abdest, acknow, acorsy, adempt, adipsy, agnosy, befist, behint,
> beknow, bijoux, biopsy, cestuy, chintz, deflux, dehors, dehort,
> deinos, diluvy, dimpsy


Write a method called `isAbecedarian` that takes a `String` and returns a `boolean` indicating whether the word is abecedarian.
