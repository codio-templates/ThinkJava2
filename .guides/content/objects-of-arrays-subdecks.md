The first step of merge sort is to split the deck into two “subdecks”, each with about half of the cards. So we need a method that takes a deck, and a range of indexes, and returns a new deck that contains the specified subset of cards. 
This method can be seen [at the left.](open_file code/ch13/Deck.java panel=0 ref="subdeck" count=7)

```code
public Deck subdeck(int low, int high) {
    Deck sub = new Deck(high - low + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < sub.cards.length; i++) {
        sub.cards[i] = this.cards[low + i];
    }
    return sub;
}
```

[The first line](open_file code/ch13/Deck.java panel=0 ref="new Deck" count=1) creates an unpopulated `Deck` object that contains an array of `null` references.

 Inside the `for` loop, the subdeck gets populated with references to `Card` objects.


The length of the subdeck is `high - low + 1`, because both the low card and the high card are included. This sort of computation can be confusing, and forgetting the “`+ 1`” often leads to **off-by-one** errors. Drawing a picture is usually the best way to avoid them.



Figure 13.2 is a memory diagram of a subdeck with `low = 0` and `high = 4`. The result is a hand with five cards that are *shared* with the original deck; that is, they are aliased.

Aliasing might not be a good idea, because changes to shared cards would be reflected in multiple decks. But since `Card` objects are immutable, this kind of aliasing is not a problem. And it saves some memory because we don't create duplicate `Card` objects.
