The code for this chapter is in the *ch07* directory of *ThinkJavaCode2*. See page in section Using the Code Examples for instructions on how to download the repository. Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

If you haven't already, take a look at Appendix 21, where we've collected some of our favorite debugging advice. It refers to language features we haven't yet covered, but it's good for you to know what's available when you need it.
