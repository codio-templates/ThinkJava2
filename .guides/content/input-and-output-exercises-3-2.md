Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read a `double` value from the keyboard, (3) calculate the result, and (4) format the output to one decimal place. When it's finished, it should work like this:

```code
Enter a temperature in Celsius: 24
24.0 C = 75.2 F
```

Here is the formula to do the conversion: $ F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 $ *Hint:* Be careful not to use integer division!
