You can display the current value of a variable by using `print` or `println`. The following statements declare a variable named `firstLine`, assign it the value `"Hello, again!"`, and display that value:

```code
String firstLine = "Hello, again!";
System.out.println(firstLine);
```


When we talk about displaying a variable, we generally mean the *value* of the variable. To display the *name* of a variable, you have to put it in quotes:

```code
System.out.print("The value of firstLine is ");
System.out.println(firstLine);
```

For this example, the output is as follows:

```code
The value of firstLine is Hello, again!
```

Conveniently, the code for displaying a variable is the same regardless of its type. For example:

```code
int hour = 11;
int minute = 59;
System.out.print("The current time is ");
System.out.print(hour);
System.out.print(":");
System.out.print(minute);
System.out.println(".");
```

The output of this program is shown here:

```code
The current time is 11:59.
```

To output multiple values on the same line, it's common to use several `print` statements followed by `println` at the end. But don't forget the `println`! On many computers, the output from `print` is stored without being displayed until `println` is run; then the entire line is displayed at once. If you omit the `println`, the program might display the stored output at unexpected times or even terminate without displaying anything.
