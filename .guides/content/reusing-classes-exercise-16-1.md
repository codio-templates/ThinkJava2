The last section of this chapter introduced `Automaton` as an abstract class and rewrote `Conway` as a subclass of `Automaton`. Now it's your turn: rewrite `Langton` as a subclass of `Automaton`, removing the code that's no longer needed.

{Compile Add'l Classes}(javac code/ch16/Automaton.java code/ch16/Cell.java code/ch16/GridCanvas.java)

{Try it!}(bash .guides/swing.sh cd code/ch16 javac Langton.java java Langton )
