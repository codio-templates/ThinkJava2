In this chapter, you have seen relational and logical operators, `if` statements, boolean methods, and validating input. The program on the left shows how the individual code examples in the previous section fit together.



Notice that the `return` statement allows you to exit a method before you reach the end of it. Returning from `main` terminates the program.

What started as five lines of code at the beginning of Section 5.9 is now a 30-line program. Making programs robust (and secure) often requires a lot of additional checking, as shown in this example.


It's important to write comments every few lines to make your code easier to understand. Comments not only help other people read your code, but also help you document what you're trying to do. If there's a mistake in the code, finding it will be a lot easier when there are good comments.
