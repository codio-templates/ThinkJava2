**Exercise 2.1:**
If you are using this book in a class, you might enjoy this exercise. Find a partner and play *Stump the Chump*:

Start with a program that compiles and runs correctly. One player looks away, while the other player adds an error to the program. Then the first player tries to find and fix the error. You get two points if you find the error without compiling the program, one point if you find it using the compiler, and your opponent gets a point if you don't find it.
