Write a method called `letterHist` that takes a string as a parameter and returns a histogram of the letters in the string.
The zeroth element of the histogram should contain the number of a's in the string (upper- and lowercase); the 25th element should contain the number of z's. 
Your solution should traverse the string only once.
Once you have written your function and added test cases, run your code here.
