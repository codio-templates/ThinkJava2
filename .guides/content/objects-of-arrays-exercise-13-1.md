Write a `toString` method for the `Deck` class. It should return a single string that represents the cards in the deck. When it's printed, this string should display the same results as the `print` method in Section 13.1.
*Hint:* You can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings, but that is not very efficient. Consider using `StringBuilder` instead; see Section 10.11.
