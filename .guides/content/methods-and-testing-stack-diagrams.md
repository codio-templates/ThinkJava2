One way to keep track of variables is to draw a **stack diagram**, which is a memory diagram (see Section 2.3) that shows currently running methods. For each method there is a box, called a **frame**, that contains the method's parameters and local variables. The name of the method appears outside the frame; the variables and parameters appear inside.

As with memory diagrams, stack diagrams show variables and methods at a particular point in time. Figure 4.1 is a stack diagram at the beginning of the `printTime` method. Notice that `main` is on top, because it executed first.

Stack diagrams help you to visualize the **scope** of a variable, which is the area of a program where a variable can be used.


Stack diagrams are a good mental model for how variables and methods work at run-time. Learning to trace the execution of a program on paper (or on a whiteboard) is a useful skill for communicating with other programmers.

Educational tools can automatically draw stack diagrams for you. For example, Java Tutor ([https://thinkjava.org/javatutor](https://thinkjava.org/javatutor)) allows you to step through an entire program, both forward and backward, and see the stack frames and variables at each step.
