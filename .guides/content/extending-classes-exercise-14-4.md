When we designed the program for this chapter, we tried to minimize the number of classes. As a result, we ended up with a few awkward methods. For example, `cardMatches` is a static method in `Player`, but it would be more natural if it were an instance method in `Card`.

The problem is that `Card` is supposed to be useful for any card game, not just Crazy Eights. You can solve this problem by adding a new class, `EightsCard`, that extends `Card` and provides a method, `match`, that checks whether two cards match according to the rules of Crazy Eights.

At the same time, you could create a new class, `EightsHand`, that extends `Hand` and provides a method, `scoreHand`, that adds up the scores of the cards in the hand. And while you're at it, you could add a method named `scoreCard` to `EightsCard`.

Whether or not you actually make these changes, draw a UML class diagram that shows this alternative object hierarchy.
