The goal of this exercise is to practice encapsulation and generalization using some of the examples in previous chapters.



1. Starting with the code in Section 7.5, write a method called `powArray` that takes a `double` array, `a`, and returns a new array that contains the elements of `a` squared. Generalize it to take a second argument and raise the elements of `a` to the given power.
1. Starting with the code in Section 7.8, write a method called `histogram` that takes an `int` array of scores from 0 to (but not including) 100, and returns a histogram of 100 counters. Generalize it to take the number of counters as an argument.
