In Section 13.2, we introduced top-down design. In this way of developing programs, we identify high-level goals, like shuffling a deck, and break them into smaller problems, like choosing a random element or swapping two elements.


In this section, we present **bottom-up design**, which goes the other way around: first we identify simple pieces we need and then we assemble them into more-complex algorithms.

Looking at the rules of Crazy Eights, we can identify some of the methods we'll need:



* Create the deck, the players, and the discard and draw piles. Deal the cards and set up the game. (`Eights` constructor)
* Check whether the game is over. (`isDone`)
* If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and move the cards into the draw pile. (`reshuffle`)
* Draw a card, reshuffling the discard pile if necessary. (`drawCard`)
* Keep track of whose turn it is, and switch from one player to the next. (`nextPlayer`)
* Display the state of the game, and wait for the user before running the next turn. (`displayState`)



Now we can start implementing the pieces. Here is the beginning of the class definition for `Eights`, which encapsulates the state [ of the game:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public class Eights" count=7)



```code
public class Eights {

    private Player one;
    private Player two;
    private Hand drawPile;
    private Hand discardPile;
    private Scanner in;
```

 In this version, there are always two players. One of the exercises at the end of the chapter asks you to modify this code to handle more players. The `Eights` class also includes a draw pile, a discard pile, and a `Scanner`, which we will use to prompt the user after each turn.

The constructor for `Eights` initializes the instance variables and deals the cards, similar to Section 14.3. The next piece we'll need is a method that checks whether the game is over. If either hand is empty, [ weâ€™re done:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public boolean isDone" count=3)


```code
public boolean isDone() {
    return one.getHand().isEmpty() || two.getHand().isEmpty();
}
```

 When the draw pile is empty, we have to shuffle the discard pile. Here is a method [ for that:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public void reshuffle" count=13)


```code
public void reshuffle() {
    Card prev = discardPile.popCard();
    discardPile.dealAll(drawPile);
    discardPile.addCard(prev);
    drawPile.shuffle();
}
```

 The first line saves the top card from `discardPile`. The next line transfers the rest of the cards to `drawPile`. Then we put the saved card back into `discardPile` and shuffle `drawPile`. We can use `reshuffle` as part of the `draw` [ method:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public Card drawCard" count=6)


```code
public Card drawCard() {
    if (drawPile.isEmpty()) {
        reshuffle();
    }
    return drawPile.popCard();
}
```

 The `nextPlayer` method takes the current player as a parameter and returns the player [ who should go next:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public Player nextPlayer" count=7)


```code
public Player nextPlayer(Player current) {
    if (current == one) {
        return two;
    } else {
        return one;
    }
}
```

 The last method from our bottom-up design is `displayState`. It displays the hand of each player, the contents of the discard pile, and the number of cards in the draw pile. Finally, it waits for the user to press the [ Enter key:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public void displayState" count=8)


```code
public void displayState() {
    one.display();
    two.display();
    discardPile.display();
    System.out.println("Draw pile:");
    System.out.println(drawPile.size() + " cards");
    in.nextLine();
}
```

 Using these pieces, we can write `takeTurn`, which executes one player's turn. It reads the top card off the discard pile and passes it to `player.play`, which you saw in the previous section. The result is the card the player chose, which is added to the [ discard pile:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public void takeTurn" count=8)


```code
public void takeTurn(Player player) {
    Card prev = discardPile.lastCard();
    Card next = player.play(this, prev);
    discardPile.addCard(next);

    System.out.println(player.getName() + " plays " + next);
    System.out.println();
}
```

 Finally, we use `takeTurn` and the other methods to write [  playGame:](open_file code/ch14/Eights.java panel=0 ref="public void playGame" count=14)


```code
public void playGame() {
    Player player = one;

    // keep playing until there's a winner
    while (!isDone()) {
        displayState();
        takeTurn(player);
        player = nextPlayer(player);
    }

    // display the final score
    one.displayScore();
    two.displayScore();
}
```

 Done! The result of bottom-up design is similar to top-down: we have a high-level method that calls helper methods. The difference is the development process we used to arrive at this solution.
